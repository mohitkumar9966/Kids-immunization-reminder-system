### Frontend
- The *frontend/* folder contains the React application. It has all the necessary components, views, and logic for the user interface.

### Backend
- The *backend_part.zip* file contains the backend code necessary for the application's functionality. Please follow the steps below to set it up.

## Setting Up the Backend

1. **Unzip the backend_part.zip** file:
   - After downloading the project, locate the backend_part.zip file inside the project directory.
   - Unzip this file into a new folder called *backend/*. 

2. **Install Java and Maven** (if not installed):
- Ensure that *Java JDK* and *Maven* are installed on your machine.
- You can check if Java is installed with:
  bash
  java -version
  
- You can check if Maven is installed with:
  bash
  mvn -version
  
- If not installed, you can download them from:
  - [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
  - [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

3. **Navigate to the backend/ folder** and build the Java project:
- Open the terminal and navigate to the backend directory:
  bash
  cd backend
  
- If using Maven, run the following to build the project:
  bash
  mvn clean install
  

4. **Run the Java backend server**:
- After building, you can run the backend server using:
  bash
  mvn spring-boot:run
  
- The backend should now be running on http://localhost:8080 (or whichever port is specified in your application).

## Setting Up the Frontend (React)

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Folder**:
- Go to the frontend directory.
bash
cd frontend


2. **Install Frontend Dependencies**:
- npm install
- npm start to run
- The frontend should now be running on http://localhost:3000
